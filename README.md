# Fourier Neural Operator
This repository contains the code for the paper:
- [(FNO) Fourier Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895)

In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efficient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and the Navier-Stokes equation (including the turbulent regime). Our Fourier neural operator shows state-of-the-art performance compared to existing neural network methodologies and it is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers.

It follows from the previous works:
- [(GKN) Neural Operator: Graph Kernel Network for Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03485)
- [(MGKN) Multipole Graph Neural Operator for Parametric Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09535)
